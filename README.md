Natural Language Processing
===========================

Natural language processing (NLP) can be used to answer a variety of
questions about unstructured text, as well as facilitating open-ended
exploration. It can be applied to datasets such as emails, online
articles and comments, tweets and novels. Although the source is text,
transformations are applied to convert this data to vectors,
dictionaries and symbols which can be handled very effectively by q.
Many operations such as searching, clustering, and keyword extraction
can all be done using very simple data structures, such as feature
vectors. \# Word Embedding

Word embedding is a term used for the representation of words for text
analysis, typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the
meaning of the word such that the words that are closer in the vector
space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be
obtained using a set of language modeling and feature learning
techniques where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to
vectors of real numbers. Conceptually it involves the mathematical
embedding from space with many dimensions per word to a continuous
vector space with a much lower dimension.
